# Working with websockets

Baserow uses [Django Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to handle websocket connections.

## Consumers

The communication between connected clients (like the Baserow web-frontend) and Baserow backend is done through Django Channels [consumers](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/consumers.html). A consumer is akin to a Django view. It can receive payloads from a client and send payloads to the client. The difference is that consumers are stateful and handle communication back and forth for the whole duration of a websocket connection.

Similarly to Django views, consumers are hooked to a particular URL, see this excerpt from `backend/src/baserow/ws/routing.py` on how the `CoreConsumer` is routed:

```python
websocket_urlpatterns = [re_path(r"^ws/core/", CoreConsumer.as_asgi())]
```

The above example shows that any client that wants to establish a websocket connection using the `ws/core/` URL (with ws protocol) will be handled by the `CoreConsumer`.

Each consumer has access to the connectionâ€™s [scope](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/consumers.html#scope) which is like the `request` object in traditional views, holding various information about the connection.

### AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer

We use [`AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer`](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/consumers.html#asyncjsonwebsocketconsumer) from the Django Channels library as the base for our consumers since we want to exchange JSON payloads. These consumers typically have three main event handlers: `connect` (for setting up the connection or revoking the connection), `disconnect` (for cleanup), and `receive_json` (for reacting to client's messages).

In each AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer, we will typically want to:

- React to client's messages in `receive_json`
- Send messages back to the connected client via `self.send_json(..)`
- React to custom events by implementing our own event handlers as class methods, e.g. `async def react_to_custom_event(self, event):`. Custom events are for handeling messages coming from other consumers or other backend code as opposed to handeling messages from clients.
- Join channel layer groups via `self.channel_layer.group_add(..)` to subscribe clients to additional events (more on that below).

Let's have a look at a simple consumer:

```python
class MyConsumer(AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        await self.accept()

        # We can access the scope object holding connection's information
        # In this case Django Channels will provide
        # authenticated user
        user = self.scope["user"]

        if not user:
            # We don't have to allow the connection to
            # be established.
            await self.close()
            return

        # Join every new connection to the "users" channel group
        # that can be used to later broadcast messages to everyone
        await self.channel_layer.group_add("users", self.channel_name)

    async def disconnect(self, message):
        # Remove the connection from a channel group
        await self.channel_layer.group_discard("users", self.channel_name)

    async def receive_json(self, content, **parameters):
        # Process a message from a client

        # If client sends "Hi", say Hello back
        if "hi" in content:
          self.send_json({"message": "Hello back!"})

    # Event handlers

    async def react_to_custom_event(self, event):
        # To invoke this event we will need to manually
        # send a message to channel layer with this event name
        ...
```

### CoreConsumer

The main Baserow consumer is `CoreConsumer` (from `backend/src/baserow/ws/consumers.py`). It currently handles all web-frontend connections, all backend events and exchange of all messages between clients and the backend.

## Channel Layer and Channel Groups

In essense, a [channel layer](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/channel_layers.html) facilitates cross-process communication like the communication between consumers themselves or between consumers and any other backend code that needs to send messages to connected clients. Baserow uses [RedisChannelLayer](https://github.com/django/channels_redis/) for this purpose.

Each consumer has a unique *channel name* (the `self.channel_name` in the example above), and can join arbitrary-named groups, allowing both point-to-point and broadcast messaging.

Currently, `CoreConsumer`s use these channel groups for broadcasts:

- `users` for all connected clients (includes anonymous users)
- page groups representing "table", "view", or "row" pages that have been originally created for people browsing these pages to receive real-time updates
- permission-oriented groups to track consumers that need to listen to permission updates and be able to disconnect from channel groups that they shouldn't be a part of anymore

## Pages and Subscriptions

`CoreConsumer` has a concept of *pages* that a client can subscribe to in order to receive messages targeting specific pages. Clients have to manually request to be subscribed with a special payload. The consumer can then check if the client has the permissions necessary to receive these page updates and if so, add itself to the particular channel group representing the page.

For example, users can subscribe to receive updates to a particular Baserow table. If the request is permitted, the consumer handling the connection will join `table-{id}` channel group and start receiving messages related to the table page with the particular id.

Each page that can be subscribed is implemented as a `PageType` and registered in `page_registry` so it is possible to implement new page types without making changes to the consumer itself. See `backend/src/baserow/ws/registries.py` for details.

## Message Broadcasting

Often we need to notify connected clients about something. For example, clients subscribed to a table page need real-time updates about created or updated rows.

The main method to send a message to all consumers (all clients) in a particular channel group is through `send_message_to_channel_group()` function in `backend/src/baserow/ws/tasks.py`. The `message` parameter should contain the `type` parameter referring to the event handler that will be invoked on each consumer:

```python
from baserow.ws.tasks import send_message_to_channel_group
from asgiref.sync import async_to_sync
from channels.layers import get_channel_layer

channel_layer = get_channel_layer()

message = {
  "type": "react_to_custom_event",
  # ...event payload
}

group = "table-2"

async_to_sync(send_message_to_channel_group)(channel_layer, group, message)
```

## Front-end

Websocket connections are automatically established for each user, including anonymous users, in the main page layout `web-frontend/modules/core/layouts/app.vue` when the Baserow web-frontend is loaded. Interacting with the backend using websocket connections is abstracted in `RealTimeHandler` class which is available in Vue components under `this.$realtime` property.

Consult client-side documentation in `docs/apis/web-socket-api.md` for implementing webscocket clients for Baserow.
