/**
 * This mixin provides basic job control capabilities using job store.
 *
 * The purpose is to centralize job state management using job store. Components that
 * use this mixin are responsible for job object creation and adding it to the store.
 * This is because specific jobs are created using domain-specific API endpoints and not
 * using generic jobs API. A job that has been created should be added to the store
 * with createAndMonitorJob method during component's initialization.
 *
 * Job state changes are handled with callbacks. A component that want to use this
 * mixin should provide following methods:
 * - onJobFinished() (optional) is called if the job successfully finishes.
 * - onJobFailed() (optional) is called if the job fails.
 * - onJobCancelled() (optional) is called if a job has been cancelled.
 * - onJobCancelFailed() (optional) is called when a job cancellation request failed.
 * - showError({error,message}) handles an error. This can be provided by `error` mixin,
 *   but a class can provide own implementation here.
 * - `getCustomHumanReadableJobState(state)` returns the human readable message your
 *   custom state values. This mixin provides a default implementation.
 *
