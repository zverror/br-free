    This class keeps track of foreign keys to other fields which need to be set once
    we have bulk created a set of fields.

    For example, when importing a table/database/workspace we have to go through and
    create many fields all at once. Fields can have FKs to other fields, but because we
    can only create fields one a time we can't set these FKs to other fields as
    they might not exist yet.

    This class keeps track of which foreign keys which need to be set once all
    depenencies have been created in the database. At which point you can call
    `run_deferred_fk_updates` with a mapping from the original field ids to
    the new ones to bulk setup all the pending FKs.
