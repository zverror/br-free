# Baserow's dev environment

The dev environment runs Baserow services with source code hot reloading enabled. It
also runs the backend django server and web-frontend nuxt server in debug and
development modes. It is recommended that you use [dev.sh](../development/dev_sh.md)
found in the root of the Baserow repo.

## Fixing git blame

A large formatting only commit was made to the repo when we converted to use the black
auto-formatter on April, 12 2021. If you don't want to see this commit in git blame, you

repo:

```bash
$ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```
