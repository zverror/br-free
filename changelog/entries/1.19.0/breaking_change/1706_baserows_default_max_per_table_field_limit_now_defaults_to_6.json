    "message": "Baserows default max per table field limit now defaults to 600 due to full text search and undo/redo needing to use the rest of the postgres 1600 column limit. This can be reverted using the new BASEROW_MAX_FIELD_LIMIT env var. If you want to have more than 600 fields we also recommend you turn off full text search as it needs an extra column per field to work, this can be done by setting BASEROW_USE_PG_FULLTEXT_SEARCH to false.",
