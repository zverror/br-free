# Deprecations

## API deprecations

Baserow may, from time to time, deprecate functionality in its REST and/or Websocket 
API. To ensure that your application runs smoothly, and without downtime, we will use this
page to inform API integrators of what features are deprecated, and how long we'll
support compatibility for.
