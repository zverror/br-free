The table below shows all available environment variables supported by Baserow.
Some environment variables have different defaults, are not supported, are optional etc
depending on how you installed Baserow. See the specific installation guides for how
to set these environment variables.

## Environment Variables

The installation methods referred to in the variable descriptions are:

* [The Standalone service images](install-using-standalone-images.md)
* [The baserow/baserow "all in one" image](install-with-docker.md)
* [The Docker compose install](install-with-docker-compose.md)

> Variables marked with *Internal* should only be changed if you know what you are
> doing.

In most situations you will not need to set this as the hostnames from BASEROW\_PUBLIC\_URL or PUBLIC\_BACKEND\_URL will be added to the ALLOWED_HOSTS automatically. This is only needed if you need to allow additional different hosts to be able to access your Baserow.                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                               |
| PRIVATE\_BACKEND\_URL                          | **Only change this with standalone images.** This is the URL used when the web-frontend server directly queries the backend itself when doing server side rendering. As such not only the browser, but also<br>the web-frontend server should be able to make HTTP requests to the backend. The web-frontend nuxt server might not have access to the \`PUBLIC\_BACKEND\_URL\` or there could be a more direct route, (e.g. from container to container instead of via the internet). For example if the web-frontend and backend were containers on the same docker network this could be set to http://backend:8000. |                                                                                               |

| BASEROW\_AMOUNT\_OF\_WORKERS               | The number of concurrent celery worker processes used to process asynchronous tasks. If not set will default to the number of available cores. Each celery process uses memory, to reduce Baserow's memory footprint consider setting and reducing this variable.                | 1 for the All-in-one, Heroku and Cloudron images. Defaults to empty and hence the number of available cores in the standalone images. |
| BASEROW\_RUN\_MINIMAL                      | When BASEROW\_AMOUNT\_OF\_WORKERS is 1 and this is set to a non empty value Baserow will not run the export-worker but instead run both the celery export and normal tasks on the normal celery worker. Set this to lower the memory usage of Baserow in expense of performance. |                                                                                                                                       |
| BASEROW\_MAX\_HEALTHY\_CELERY\_QUEUE\_SIZE | Used as maximum values in the `/api/_health/celery-queue/?queue=celery&queue=export` endpoint. If the number of tasks in the queue exceeds this value, then the health check fails.                                                                                              | 10                                                                                                                                    |

| BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_ALLOW\_PRIVATE\_ADDRESS             | If set to any non empty value allows webhooks to access all addresses. Enabling this flag is a security risk as it will allow users to send webhook requests to internal addresses on your network. Instead consider using the three variables below first to allow access to only some internal network hostnames or IPs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |            |
| BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_URL\_REGEX\_BLACKLIST               | **Disabled if BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_ALLOW\_PRIVATE\_ADDRESS is set.** List of comma seperated regexes used to validate user configured webhook URLs, will show the user an error if any regexes match their webhook URL and prevent it from running. Applied before and so supersedes BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_WHITELIST and BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_BLACKLIST. Do not include any schema like `http://`, `https://` as regexes will only be run against the hostname/IP of the user configured URL. For example set this to `^(?!(www\.)?allowedhost\.com).*` to block all hostnames and IPs other than `allowedhost.com` or `www.allowedhost.com`.                                       |            |
| BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_WHITELIST                       | **Disabled if BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_ALLOW\_PRIVATE\_ADDRESS is set.** List of comma seperated IP addresses or ranges that webhooks will be **allowed** to use after the webhook URL has been resolved to an IP using DNS. Only checked if the URL passes the BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_URL\_REGEX\_BLACKLIST. Takes precedence over BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_BLACKLIST meaning that a whitelisted IP will always be let through regardless of the ranges in BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_BLACKLIST. So use BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_WHITELIST to punch holes the ranges in BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_BLACKLIST, and not the other way around. Accepts a string in the format: "127.0.0.1/32,192.168.1.1/32" |            |
| BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_BLACKLIST                       | **Disabled if BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_ALLOW\_PRIVATE\_ADDRESS is set.** List of comma seperated IP addresses or ranges that webhooks will be **denied** from using after the URL has been resolved to an IP using DNS. Only checked if the URL passes the BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_URL\_REGEX\_BLACKLIST. BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_WHITELIST supersedes any ranges specified in this variable. Accepts a string in the format: "127.0.0.1/32,192.168.1.1/32"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |            |

### User file upload Configuration

Baserow needs somewhere to store the following types of files:
* Files uploaded by users in Baserow Table's using the File Field type
* User triggered exports of tables and views

#### Filesystem Default

By default, Baserow will store these files on the file system at the location set by
the MEDIA_ROOT environment variable, which is `/baserow/media` in our `baserow/backend`
image or `$DATA_DIR/media` for the `baserow/baserow` all-in-one image.

> Warning: If Baserow is storing user files on the file system and MEDIA_ROOT is not part
> of a persistent volume, then all uploaded user files will be lost if
> you remove the container. Our default docker commands and docker compose
> files ensure this location will be mounted to a persistent docker volume for you if
> you are using them.
>
#### Serving User Files when stored on the file system

Any uploaded files need to be served back to the user when they visit Baserow in the
browser. Our `baserow/baserow` image and some of our `docker-compose.yml` templates
come with a [Caddy](https://caddy.io) reverse proxy which is configured to serve
back any user uploaded files which are stored in the data/media volume.

If you do not wish to use our default Caddy see the following guides on configuring
an Apache, NGinx or Traefik to serve user files for you:
* [Apache](./install-behind-apache.md)
* [Nginx](./install-behind-nginx.md)
* [Traefik](./install-with-traefik.md)


#### File Service alternatives

You can alternatively configure Baserow to store files by uploading them to an external service.
This is highly recommended if you wish to horizontally scale Baserow or deploy it in
a distributed manner.

We support the following types of file storage service. Follow each link to documentation showing
all available UPPER_CASE settings that you can set as environment variables to set up the
desired provider.

* [AWS S3, or any S3 compatible service such as Backblaze or Digital Ocean spaces](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/1.13.2/backends/amazon-S3.html#settings)
  * When using AWS S3 we recommend you set the `DOWNLOAD_FILE_VIA_XHR=1` environment variable.
* [Google Cloud Storage](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/1.13.2/backends/gcloud.html#settings)
* [Azure Cloud Storage](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/1.13.2/backends/azure.html#settings)

Our default docker compose files do not by default include all available user file environment
variables to reduce their size. When using these docker compose files make sure that any
`AWS_`, `GS_` or `AZURE_` env vars you wish to use have been added to the
`x-backend-variables` section.

#### CORS Issues

When using a 3rd party file storage service which is serving files from another
domain than your Baserow, you need to make sure CORS is configured correctly.

| EMAIL\_SMTP                      | If set to any non empty value then Baserow will start sending emails using the configuration options below. If not set then Baserow will not send emails and just log them to the Celery worker logs instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |          |
| EMAIL\_SMTP\_USE\_TLS            | If set to any non empty value then Baserow will attempt to send emails using TLS.Whether to use a TLS (secure) connection when talking to the SMTP server. This is used for explicit TLS connections, generally on port 587. If you are experiencing hanging connections, see the implicit TLS setting EMAIL\_SMTP\_USE\_SSL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |          |
| EMAIL\_SMTP\_USE\_SSL            | If set to any non empty value then an implicit TLS (secure) connection will be used when talking to the SMTP server. In most email documentation this type of TLS connection is referred to as SSL. It is generally used on port 465. If you are experiencing problems, see the explicit TLS setting EMAIL\_SMTP\_USE\_TLS. Note that EMAIL\_SMTP\_USE\_TLS/EMAIL\_SMTP\_USE\_SSL are mutually exclusive, so only set one of those settings to True.                                                                                                                                                         |          |

| EMAIL\_SMTP\_SSL\_CERTFILE\_PATH | If EMAIL\_SMTP\_USE\_SSL or EMAIL\_SMTP\_USE\_TLS is set, you can optionally specify the path to a PEM-formatted certificate chain file to use for the SSL connection. If using docker then you will need to mount in this file into all the Baserow backend containers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |          |
| EMAIL\_SMTP\_SSL\_KEYFILE\_PATH  | EMAIL\_SMTP\_USE\_SSL or EMAIL\_SMTP\_USE\_TLS is set, you can optionally specify the path to a PEM-formatted private key file to use for the SSL connection. If using docker then you will need to mount in this file into all the Baserow backend containers. Note that setting EMAIL\_SMTP\_SSL\_CERTFILE\_PATH and EMAIL\_SMTP\_SSL\_KEYFILE\_PATH doesn’t result in any certificate checking. They’re passed to the underlying SSL connection. Please refer to the documentation of Python’s ssl.wrap_socket() function for details on how the certificate chain file and private key file are handled. |          |

| BASEROW\_ALLOW\_MULTIPLE\_SSO\_PROVIDERS\_FOR\_SAME\_ACCOUNT | By default Baserow will show a "please use the provider that you originally signed up with" error if you attempt to login to an email which has been already registered in your Baserow server with a different SSO provider/authentication method. This is to increase the security of your Baserow server. However, if you wish to allow a user who for example signed up initially using email and password to now login using a new SSO provider, and are comfortable with the increased risk of allowing this, then set this environment variable to any non empty value to disable this check. When turned on this environment variable will allow a Baserow account to be logged into by any available authentication method and not just the first one that particular user signed up with. If you later turn off this environment variable by removing it, users who have previously logged into their account with multiple different providers will be able to continue to use all of those providers to login, however any new users will be forced to use the first provider they signed up with. |          |
