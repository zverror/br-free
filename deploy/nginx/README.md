This folder contains docker-compose files we use for testing our example nginx
configuration with Baserow. 

**These testing files are designed to work with docker-compose so if your
nginx is not running inside a Docker container you will have to make modifications
if using this files as examples.**

Please read
the [../../docs/installation/install-behind-nginx.md](../../docs/installation/install-behind-nginx.md)
for more information on this folder.
